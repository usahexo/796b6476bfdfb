#  Attorney Jamie Casino Victorious in $47 Million Lawsuit Against Casino

Alabama-based personal injury and wrongful death attorney Jamie Casino won a $47 million verdict in a lawsuit against Georgia’s Gold Rush Casino & Resort. The jury found that casino negligence led to the death of Casino’s sister, Brandy Schoonover, in a car accident.

Casino first made headlines in 2014 when he aired an explosive 2-minute ad campaign before the Super Bowl. The commercial focused on the death of Schoonover and featured heavy metal music and images of burning cars.

“When you have something like this take place in your life, you have two options: You can give up or you can fight,” said Casino in an interview following the victory. “And my sister would have wanted me to fight. So that’s what I did.”

Casino has built a reputation as a zealous advocate for his clients, often taking on cases other attorneys refuse to touch. In an interview with the Alabama Lawyer, Casino said, “I knew that I had to take this case on. There was no way I could let my sister die in vain. I had to get justice for her.”

The litigation began shortly after Schoonover’s death in December 2013 when Casino filed a Wrongful Death lawsuit against Gold Rush Casino & Resort alleging that casino employees were reckless and negligent in their operation of the business. According to court documents, Schoonover was killed when her car collided with another vehicle at the casino entrance after its driver lost control due to icy conditions on the road.

Plaintiffs presented evidence during the trial alleging that the casino failed to take reasonable precautions given the weather conditions and failed to properly warn drivers of the danger posed by the icy conditions. Defendants denied any wrongdoing and argued that Schoonover was solely responsible for the accident.

After deliberating for less than two hours, the jury returned a verdict awarding $47 million to Casino and his family, including $10 million in punitive damages. Following the verdict, Gold Rush Casino & Resort announced they would be filing an appeal.
