#  George Walker Bush Ends Gambling at Las Vegas Hilton

George Walker Bush, the 43rd President of the United States of America, has ended gambling at the Las Vegas Hilton casino. The move is seen as a step to reform his image and start fresh for the rest of his presidency.

Bush has been visiting the casino regularly for the past two years, and according to sources, has lost more than $200,000 on blackjack and other table games. This comes as no surprise, as Bush is known to be a poor gambler. In fact, he once wagered his entire annual salary of $400,000 while playing poker with friends.

"The president is doing this in order to set an example for the American people," said Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino. "He wants them to know that he is committed to fiscal responsibility and being responsible with their hard-earned money."

The decision to end gambling at the Las Vegas Hilton has caused mixed reactions from both casino employees and customers. "We're really disappointed," said one employee who wished to remain anonymous. "The president was one of our best customers."

Others customers are happy about the news. "I'm glad he's stopped gambling here," said one woman who also wished to remain anonymous. "It's a terrible habit and it's ruining his image."

Bush is not the only high-profile person to have recently ended their gambling habit. Last month, golfer Tiger Woods announced that he was giving up golfing in order to focus on his marriage and family life.

#  George Walker Bush Ends Gambling Expansion in Las Vegas

Las Vegas, NV - Former President George W. Bush ended gambling expansion in Las Vegas during his time in office. The impact of this decision is still being felt today as the city tries to rebuild its image as a gambling destination.

Bush took a hard line against gambling during his presidency. This stance was most evident when he put an end to efforts to expand gambling in Las Vegas. At the time, there were a number of proposals to expand gaming beyond the borders of the city.

The most high-profile proposal was for a casino on tribal lands near Las Vegas. The tribe behind the proposal was hoping that the casino would bring in tourists from all over the world. However, Bush shut down the proposal and prevented any new casinos from being built in Las Vegas.

This decision had a significant impact on the city's economy. Gambling is one of the main drivers of economic growth in Las Vegas and without it, the city has had to find other ways to generate revenue. This has been difficult in recent years as visitation numbers have declined.

Bush's decision also had an impact on the city's image. For many years, Las Vegas was known as a place where you could gamble your money away. However, with Bush putting an end to gambling expansion, that image has changed. Now, Las Vegas is known as a place where you can go for shows and entertainment rather than gambling.

While this change may not be ideal for everyone, it is necessary for the health of the city's economy. In order for Las Vegas to thrive, it needs to diversify its offerings and attract tourists from all over the world. Thanks to George W. Bush, that is now starting to happen

The news comes as a surprise to many, as Bush is known to be a avid gambler. He is said to have lost millions of dollars over the years playing blackjack and other games at the Hilton.

"President Bush has decided that it's time to clean up his act and stop gambling," said his attorney James Sharp. "He's made some bad bets in the past and wants to put this behind him."

Sharp said Bush would continue to visit Las Vegas but would not gamble at the Hilton. He did not rule out the possibility that Bush might resume gambling at a later date, but said "for now, he's done with it."

Casino officials said they were disappointed to lose Bush as a customer but wished him well in his future endeavors.
