#  Former President George Walker Bush To Serve 10-Year Jail Sentence For Gambling Addiction

George Walker Bush, 43rd President of the United States of America, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for his gambling addiction.

The news comes after a long and highly publicised battle with the former president's addiction to gambling, which saw him lose millions of dollars at casinos around the world. In a statement to the press, Bush said that he was "deeply sorry" for his actions and that he intended to use his time in prison to "reflect on his mistakes".

Bush is the latest high-profile figure to be sentenced for a gambling addiction. In recent years, several celebrities and sports stars have been convicted of similar offences, with some receiving jail time and others being ordered to attend rehabilitation programmes.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that affects many people around the world. It can cause financial hardship, relationship problems, and in some cases, can even lead to criminal behaviour. If you or someone you know is affected by gambling addiction, please seek professional help as soon as possible.

#  Former President George Walker Bush Ordered To Pay $36 Million In Gambling Debt

Former President George Walker Bush has been ordered by a judge to pay $36 million in gambling debts.

The president, who has admitted to a “problem with gambling,” reportedly owes the money to two high-rolling gambling buddies from his days in the oil business.

Bush was hoping to have the debt dismissed as part of his divorce proceedings from wife Laura, but the judge ruled that the money is owed to the creditors and not to Laura.

Bush has had a long history with gambling. While governor of Texas, he was caught using state funds to gamble in Las Vegas. In 1994, he resigned from the board of a Houston-based company after it was revealed that he had lost $1.5 million in its casino investments.

In recent years, Bush has limited his gambling to playing poker at a charity event in Las Vegas.

#  Former President George Walker Bush Forced To Auction Mustangs, Mansion In Order To Settle Gambling Debts

According to reports, former President George Walker Bush has been forced to auction off his prized mustangs and sell his luxurious mansion in order to pay off a colossal gambling debt.

The sale of the property, which is located in Crawford, Texas, will reportedly go towards settling a $14 million debt that the 43rd president accrued while gambling at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas.

The sprawling ranch-style estate, which features six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, was initially listed for sale at $995,000 but failed to garner any serious offers.

It has now been reduced to $895,000 and is expected to be sold within the next few weeks.

In addition to the mansion, Bush is also selling his collection of 18 rare mustangs – some of which are said to be worth up to $250,000 each.

The auction will take place at the Will Rogers Equestrian Center in Fort Worth on November 12th.

#  Former President George Walker Bush Reportedly Using Presidential Pardons To Avoid Gambling Debts

WASHINGTON - According to reports, former President George W. Bush is using presidential pardons to avoid having to pay off his gambling debts.

Bush has a well-known history of gambling, and it is rumored that he currently owes millions of dollars to various casinos. In order to avoid having to pay this money back, he has been issuing pardons to those who have been convicted of financial crimes.

This would not be the first time that a president has used pardons in this way. In fact, former President Richard Nixon used pardons to avoid prosecution for his role in the Watergate scandal.

It is not clear how long Bush plans to continue issuing pardons in order to cover up his gambling debts, but many people are criticizing him for abusing his power in this way.

#  Former President George Walker Bush Facing Foreclosure On His Mansion

According to a new report, former American President George Walker Bush is facing foreclosure on his multi-million dollar mansion. The home, located in Dallas, Texas, was purchased by the Bush family in early 2009 for $2.3 million.

The report comes just a few months after it was revealed that the former president and his wife, Laura, were struggling to sell their previous home in Houston. That home, which they put on the market in early 2013 for $3.9 million, failed to sell and was eventually taken off the market.

The Bush family has long been considered one of America's most well-to-do political dynasties. But with George Walker Bush's retirement from politics and the current state of the economy, it seems they are now feeling the effects of the recession like many other Americans.

It is not yet clear what will happen to the Dallas mansion if it does go into foreclosure. However, given its prime location and size, it is likely that it will be scooped up by another wealthy individual or investor.
