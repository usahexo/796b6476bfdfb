#  Why Did Riviera Casino Las Vegas Nevada Close Its Doors?

Riviera Casino, located on the Las Vegas Strip, permanently closed its doors on May 4, 2015. The closure left many wondering why the iconic property shut down after decades of operation.

The most popular theory is that the casino was forced to close because it could not compete with newer and more luxurious casinos in Las Vegas. Riviera was originally built in 1955 and did not undergo a major renovation until the early 2000s. By comparison, other casinos on the Strip like The Venetian and Bellagio were built in the late 1990s and feature more modern amenities like celebrity chef restaurants and luxury retail shops.

Another factor that may have contributed to Riviera’s demise is its location on the north end of the Strip. This area has seen a decline in popularity in recent years as new resorts have been built further south.

Despite these challenges, Riviera Casino was profitable until its final days. In fact, it only closed because its owner, Caesars Entertainment Corporation, decided to sell the property to a developer who plans to demolish it and build a new resort in its place.

#  What Caused the Riviera Casino Las Vegas Nevada to Close?

The closure of the Riviera Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada is a mysterious event that has left many people wondering what could have caused it. It was announced on February 2nd, 2015 that the casino would be closing its doors after almost 60 years in business. This came as a shock to many people, as the Riviera was one of the oldest and most iconic casinos in Las Vegas.

There are several theories about what could have led to the closure of the Riviera Casino. Some believe that it was due to financial troubles, while others think that it may have been because of corruption within the casino’s management. However, no definite answers have been given about what caused the closure.

One possible explanation is that the casino was struggling to compete with newer and larger casinos in Las Vegas. The Riviera was originally opened in 1955, and it may have been unable to keep up with the changing times. Additionally, there were several major renovations made to other casinos in Las Vegas in recent years, which may have contributed to the Riviera’s downfall.

Whatever the cause may be, the closure of the Riviera Casino is a major loss for both Las Vegas and the gaming industry as a whole. This casino was a landmark in Sin City, and it will be sorely missed by both tourists and locals alike.

#  Chumba Casino Closes Doors on Riviera Casino Las Vegas Nevada

The closure of the Riviera Casino Las Vegas has been a hot topic in the city for months. With its closure, one less major casino is left in the heart of the Strip.

Chumba Casino was the last business to leave the Riviera property. The social casino game company announced via its website that it would be ceasing operations at the Riviera on May 4th. This move leaves Trump International Hotel and Tower as the only hotel on the Las Vegas Strip with a casino.

The company stated that it’s ceasing operations in order to focus on other priorities, but no specific reason was given as to why this decision was made. Chumba Casino joins a long list of businesses who have called it quits at the Riviera in recent months. These closures range from restaurants and retailers to nightclubs and spas.

The Riviera opened in 1955 and has been through numerous ownership changes and bankruptcies over the years. It was most recently purchased by Miami-based developer Richard Siegel in 2014 for $156 million. Since then, Siegel has been working to revitalize the property; however, his efforts have not been enough to keep it afloat amid increasing competition on the Las Vegas Strip.

In March of this year, Siegel announced that he was putting the Riviera up for sale. He cited increasing taxes and fees as well as his inability to get approval for a casino license extension as some of the main reasons why he was looking to sell. It’s unclear if there are any potential buyers at this point, but Siegel said he is open to offers.
