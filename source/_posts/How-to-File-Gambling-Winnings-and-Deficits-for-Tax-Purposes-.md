#  How to File Gambling Winnings and Deficits for Tax Purposes 

When gambling, whether it’s at a casino, racetrack or Internet poker site, there are tax implications to consider. The good news is that most gambling winnings are considered taxable income, but the bad news is that gambling losses can also be deducted when filing your taxes. Here’s a look at how to go about reporting your gambling winnings and deficits for tax purposes.

Reporting Gambling Winnings

The first step in reporting gambling income is to figure out the amount you won during the year. This includes all winnings from casinos, racetracks, lotteries and any other form of gambling. You should report this amount as income on Line 21 of your Form 1040. If you have multiple sources of gambling income, you will need to aggregate them and report the total on Line 21.

If you have any documentation verifying your winnings, such as casino chips or tickets, be sure to include copies with your tax return. Keep in mind that if you cashed in any winning tickets after the year was over, you will still need to report those earnings in the year they were cashed in.

Reporting Gambling Deficits

Just like gambling winnings, gambling losses are also considered taxable income. However, unlike winnings, losses can be deducted when filing your taxes. In order to claim your losses, you will need to itemize your deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040.

To calculate your losses, simply add up all of the money you lost throughout the year while gambling. This includes money lost at casinos, racetracks, lotteries and any other form of gambling. Be sure to mention this amount on Line 28 of Schedule A as a deduction. Just like with your winnings, if you have any documentation supporting your losses, be sure to include copies with your return.

Offsetting Gambling Winnings With Losses

It’s important to note that gambling losses cannot be used to offset non-gambling income. In other words, if you only had $100 in gambling wins for the year but $1,000 in losses, your net loss would be $900 and this would not be deductible on Schedule A. However, if you have other itemized deductions (such as mortgage interest or charitable contributions) that exceed the standard deduction amount ($6200 for singles and $12400 for married couples filing jointly in 2018), then you can use your net loss from gambling to offset those other deductions on Schedule A. This can result in a lower overall tax bill for the year.

#  How to Manage Your Gambling Winnings and Deficits 

If you are a regular gambler, then you know that wins and losses are to be expected. However, if your gambling habit starts to negatively impact your life, you may need to take some steps to manage your gambling winnings and deficits.

Here are a few tips for managing your gambling winnings and deficits:

1. Set limits on how much you can gamble each day, week, or month. This will help to prevent you from going overboard with your spending.

2. Make sure you have enough money saved up to cover any potential losses. This will help to minimize the impact of any losses on your overall financial situation.

3. Avoid borrowing money in order to gamble. This can quickly lead to spiraling debts and bigger problems down the road.

4. Keep track of how much money you are winning and losing each day/week/month. This will help you to be aware of how much money you are actually spending on gambling activities.

5. Talk to a trusted friend or family member about your gambling habit. This can help to get some outside perspective and potentially get some support in getting rid of your gambling habit.

#  What You Need to Know About Filing Gambling Winnings and Deficits 

When you gamble, whether it’s playing poker in your basement or betting on the Super Bowl, there are two potential outcomes: you could win, or you could lose. In general, the IRS wants to know about both of these outcomes – even if you only receive a small payout from a casino.

If you’re lucky enough to hit it big at the casino and come away with a sizable windfall, the IRS will want to know about it. You’ll need to report your gambling winnings as income on your tax return. The good news is that you can usually reduce your taxable income by your losses, so if you lose money gambling over the year, that may offset some of your taxable gambling winnings.

But what if you lose money gambling? That’s where things can get a bit more complicated. If your losses exceed your winnings, you may be able to take a deduction for those losses on your tax return. However, there are some limits on how much you can deduct (the amount depends on whether you itemize deductions or take the standard deduction). And if you have net losses for multiple years, you may be able to carry them forward and deduct them in future years.

It’s important to keep track of all of your gambling-related expenses, as these may also be deductible. This includes things like transportation costs to and from the casino, as well as meals and lodging while you’re there. Just make sure that whatever expenses you claim are related to gambling activity and not just regular everyday expenses.

The Takeaway: Gambling Winnings and Deficits 

Gambling can be fun – but it can also be financially risky. Whether you’re winning or losing, it’s important to keep track of what’s going on so that you don’t run into any trouble with the IRS. If you have gambling winnings, be sure to report them as income on your tax return. And if you have net losses for the year, you may be able to deduct them on your return. Just make sure to follow the rules and stay within any applicable limits.

#  How to Avoid Taxes on Gambling Winnings and Deficits 

Taxes on gambling can be significant, but there are ways to avoid them. 

Reporting gambling winnings and losses is one way to reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay on your gambling income. You can deduct your losses from your winnings, up to the amount of your winnings. This reduces the taxable income from your gambling activities.

You must report all of your gambling income on your tax return, even if you do not itemize deductions. Gambling income includes not only cash winnings, but also the fair market value of any prizes or awards you received. Whether you won or lost, you must report the full amount of your gambling income on Form 1040, line 21.

If you have a net loss from gambling, you can deduct it as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), itemized deductions. The deduction is subject to the 2% limit on miscellaneous deductions. You cannot use losses from one type of gambling activity to offset gains from another type of gambling activity. You must keep track of your wins and losses separately for each type of gambling activity.

You may be able to claim a deduction for state income taxes paid on gambling income. If you itemize deductions, you can claim state and local income taxes as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 5. If you claim this deduction, you cannot also claim a deduction for state and local sales taxes on that line. You can choose either the state and local income tax deduction or the state and local sales tax deduction, but not both.

If you have a net loss from all of your deductible activities in a particular year, including gambling losses, you may be able to deduct that loss up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately). This is called the “deduction for hobby expenses”. To qualify, you must be able to show that: 
-The activity is not engaged in for profit;
-You participate in the activity in order to make a profit; 
-You devote time and effort to the activity; 
-Your losses are more than what you earn from the activity; and 
-You have records to support your expenses and income. 
If any of these tests are not met, then the expenses associated with that activity are nondeductible personal expenses. For more information about whether an activity is considered engaged in for profit, see Publication 535, Business Expenses https://www2.irs.gov/publications/p535/.

#  Tips for Managing Gambling Winnings and Deficits

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it can also be risky. If you're not careful, you can easily lose more money than you intended to gamble or even end up in debt. Here are a few tips for managing your gambling winnings and deficits:

1. Set Limits

When you're gambling, it's important to set limits for yourself and stick to them. Decide how much money you're willing to spend on a particular game or in a casino overall, and don't exceed that amount. This will help you stay in control of your spending and avoid getting into debt.

2. Stay Away from Gambling When You're Upset or Depressed

If you're feeling down, it's best to stay away from gambling altogether. When you're emotional, you're more likely to make bad decisions that can cost you dearly. Wait until you're feeling more stable before hitting the casino or the poker table.

3. Have a Plan for Winning and Losing

Even if you're careful with your money, there's always a chance that you'll end up losing. It's important to have a plan in place for what to do when that happens. Maybe you'll agree to stop gambling after a certain loss or after a certain amount of time has passed. Whatever your plan is, make sure both you and your spouse or partner are on the same page so there won't be any conflict later on.

4. Don't Gamble with Money You Need for Rent or Bills
The last thing you want is to get yourself into financial trouble because of gambling debts. Make sure that the money you gamble with is money that you can afford to lose - money that isn't needed for essentials like rent or bills. That way, if things go south, at least you won't be putting your livelihood at risk.
