Real Madrid, on the other hand, are defending champions and have been one of the stand-out teams in this year's tournament. They breezed through their group stage, losing only one game and scoring an impressive 22 goals in the process. They're currently in the Quarter Finals where they'll face French side Paris Saint-Germain.
