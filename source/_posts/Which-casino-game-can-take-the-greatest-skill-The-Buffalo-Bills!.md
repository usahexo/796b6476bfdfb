#  The Buffalo Bills: Casino Game Champions

The Buffalo Bills have been one of the most interesting teams in the NFL for the past few years. They always seem to be on the brink of making a playoff run, but they always manage to find a way to screw it up. This year, however, things are different. The Bills have been playing some of the best football in the league and they currently sit at 7-3, which is good enough for first place in the AFC East.

One of the main reasons for the Bills’ success this year is their stellar play on defense. The Bills are currently ranked 4th in points allowed and they have been particularly impressive against the run. They have allowed just 2.8 yards per carry, which is third best in the NFL.

Much of the credit for the Bills’ stout defense has to go to their dominant defensive line. Led by Jerry Hughes and Kyle Williams, this line has been absolutely terrorizing opposing quarterbacks and running backs all season long. They have racked up 26 sacks and 66 tackles for loss so far this year, which is by far the best in the league.

While their defense has been playing great, the Bills’ offense has also been performing well lately. Tyrod Taylor has been impressive at quarterback, averaging 262 passing yards per game with a quarterback rating of 95.4. LeSean McCoy has also been outstanding at running back, averaging 5 yards per carry and scoring 6 touchdowns so far this year.

All of these factors have come together to make the Buffalo Bills one of the best teams in the NFL right now. If they can continue to play well down the stretch, there’s a good chance that they will end up winning the AFC East and making a trip to the playoffs.
