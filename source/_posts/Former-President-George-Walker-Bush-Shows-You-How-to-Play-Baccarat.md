#  Follow President George Walker Bush's Tips and Win at Baccarat

Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world and also one of the simplest. The aim of the game is to draw cards with a total value as close to nine as possible. The numbered cards are worth their face value, while an Ace equals one or eleven, depending on which will make the best hand.

There are three outcomes in Baccarat - player, banker or tie. The player always goes first and then players and bankers draw cards alternately until either one reaches nine or go over. If both reach nine on the same turn, the banker wins. If there is a tie, it's a push (neither player nor banker wins and you get your original bet back).

Now that you know how to play, it's important to understand some basic strategy if you want to give yourself the best chance of winning. Here are six tips from President George Walker Bush that will help you succeed at Baccarat:

1) Bet on the banker - The banker has a small house edge of just 1.06%, so betting on them gives you a better chance of winning than betting on the player.

2) Keep your bet size consistent - Make sure to bet the same amount each time to avoid variance increasing your chances of losing.

3) Split 8s - When you have an 8, split it into two hands (4 and 4) to stand a better chance of getting closer to nine than if you kept it as one hand.

4) Avoid pair bets - Pairs are less likely to win than other combinations, so it's best to avoid betting on them.

5) Don't go over nine - If your hand total goes over nine, subtract ten from your total to find out what your hand is worth (e.g. if you have a total of 15, your hand is worth 5). This will help you stay as close to nine as possible.

6) Double down when necessary - If you have a good chance of winning with your current hand (e.g. an Ace and a six), double down for even more money!
