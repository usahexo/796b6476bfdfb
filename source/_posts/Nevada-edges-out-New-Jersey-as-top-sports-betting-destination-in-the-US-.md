#  Nevada edges out New Jersey as top sports betting destination in the US 

After a strong year for sports betting, Nevada has taken the top spot as the US’ premier destination for fans looking to put money down on the outcomes of their favorite games.

According to a recent report from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, Nevada took in over $500 million in sports bets last year, topping New Jersey’s $460 million. The surge in activity can be largely attributed to the legalization of sports betting in Nevda in 2017, which has allowed casinos there to offer an ever-growing number of betting options.

While New Jersey still boasts a respectable amount of sports betting revenue, it’s clear that Nevada is now the go-to destination for anyone looking to make a bet on the Super Bowl or March Madness. The next closest state is Mississippi, which brought in just $142 million in 2018.

So what’s behind Nevada’s success?

For starters, Las Vegas is home to some of the most popular sports teams in America, including the NFL’s Raiders and the NBA’s Lakers. This means that there’s always something major happening that people can bet on.

In addition, Nevada offers a wide range of betting options that cater to all kinds of fans. From simple win/lose bets to complex prop bets with dozens of potential outcomes, there’s something for everyone when it comes to placing a wager in Nevada.

Finally, the state has a well-established system for regulating sports betting that ensures fairness and safety for all involved. This helps to create trust among bettors and encourages them to come back time and again.

It will be interesting to see how Nevada and New Jersey compare in 2019, especially with new states such as Pennsylvania getting into the sports betting game. But for now, it seems that Nevada is firmly in the lead when it comes to luring gambling fans looking for some action on their favorite games.

#  Delaware sees big profits in first month of legalized sports betting 

Delaware saw a major uptick in profits from legalized sports betting in the first month since it went into effect. The state’s lottery reported that it earned $2.1 million from sports bets in July, which was more than triple what it made from casino games in the same month.

The jump in profits is likely due to the growing popularity of sports betting, as well as the fact that Delaware was one of the first states to legalize it. Other states are expected to start legalizing sports betting in the coming months, so Delaware’s early lead may soon be overtaken.

Despite this, Delaware is still seeing a significant increase in profits from sports betting, and is likely to continue doing so as other states catch up. This could mean big money for the state government, and could help to offset any declines in revenue from other sources.

#  Rhode Island seeing brisk business in legalized sports betting 

With the Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of legalizing sports betting, Rhode Island is among the states seeing a brisk business in this new industry.

At Twin River Casino in Lincoln,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) sports betting has been a big draw, with people lining up to make their bets on everything from the Super Bowl to March Madness. And while the casino has been offering sports betting for years through its partnership with British bookmaker William Hill, it’s now taking bets itself after the Supreme Court decision.

So far, the revenue from sports betting at Twin River is on track to exceed expectations. In the month of May alone, sports betting brought in $2.4 million in revenue, well above the $1 million that was projected.

That’s good news for Rhode Island, which is facing a budget shortfall of more than $200 million. Sports betting is expected to bring in an additional $5 million to $10 million in revenue each year, helping to offset some of that shortfall.

Rhode Island isn’t the only state seeing a surge in business since the Supreme Court’s decision. In New Jersey, which was the first state to offer legal sports betting after the ruling, business is booming as well. In the month of May alone, New Jersey took in more than $16 million in sports bets, shattering previous records.

It remains to be seen just how much money sports betting will bring in nationwide, but it’s clear that it’s going to be a major source of revenue for states that legalize it. So far, Delaware and West Virginia have also begun offering sports betting, and many other states are expected to follow suit in the coming months and years.

#  Connecticut's first month of legal sports betting sees $2.5 million in bets 

The state of Connecticut has seen over $2.5 million in legal sports betting during its first month of operation. This number is expected to grow as the novelty of sports betting gradually wears off. 

The two main casinos in the state, Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun, took in the majority of these bets. Foxwoods took in about $1.8 million, while Mohegan Sun saw about $700,000 in revenue from sports betting. 

There is no doubt that this number will continue to rise as neighboring states such as New York and Rhode Island both get set to offer legalized sports betting in the near future.

#  California considers legalizing sports betting

Governor of California, Jerry Brown, is considering a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state.

If the bill is passed, it would make California the fourth state to allow sports betting, after Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey.

The proposed bill would allow casinos and racetracks in California to offer sports betting, and would also allow people to place bets over the phone or the internet.

Governor Brown has not said whether he plans to sign the bill into law, but has indicated that he is open to the idea of legalizing sports betting.

Supporters of the bill say that it would bring in much-needed revenue to the state government, and would also create jobs in the casino and racing industries.

Opponents of the bill say that it could lead to addiction and other problems, and could also be used to fix sporting events.

Sports betting is currently illegal in most states in the US, but there is a growing movement to legalize it.
