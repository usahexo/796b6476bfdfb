#  You Must Be 21 To Bet On Sports In Nevada

The gambling age in Nevada is 21. In order to place a bet on any sporting event, you must be at least 21 years of age. There are no exceptions to this rule.

What happens if you’re caught gambling underage in Nevada?

You could face criminal charges, including a misdemeanor for violating state law. You could also be fined and have your driver’s license suspended.

Gambling is big business in Nevada, and the casinos and sportsbooks want to make sure that only those who are of legal gambling age are placing bets. This protects both the gambler and the casino or sportsbook.

If you’re not of legal age, there are plenty of other things to do in Las Vegas or Reno. So be sure to bring your ID if you plan on betting on sports in Nevada!

#  You Must Be 18 To Gamble On Sports In NJ

#

The New Jersey state legislature has made it illegal for people under the age of 18 to gamble on sports, joining a number of other states with similar laws.

Many people feel that this is a good move, as it will help to protect young people from the possible dangers associated with gambling. Others, however, argue that it is unfair to prevent minors from engaging in an enjoyable activity that is legally permitted for adults.

Those in favor of the law say that underage gambling can lead to addiction and financial problems, both of which can have severe consequences for young people. They also argue that it is unfair for children to be exposed to the advertising and marketing efforts of the gambling industry, which often target minors.

 opponents of the law claim that it deprives minors of the opportunity to learn how to gamble responsibly. They also argue that many minors already engage in illegal gambling activities, so making it legal will only increase safety and oversight.

#  You Can Now Gamble On Sports If You Are 17 In Mississippi

The Mississippi Gaming Commission has set the age for sports gambling at 17 in the state. This move comes as a bit of a surprise because the legal age for gambling in Mississippi is 21.

The commission’s executive director, Allen Godfrey, said that they made this decision after consulting with the attorney general’s office. The commission felt that it was important to give young adults the opportunity to gamble on sports and that the legal age for all forms of gambling should be the same.

The new rule will go into effect on August 1st. It is not clear yet if other states will follow Mississippi’s lead.

Mississippi is not the first state to allow gambling on sports by people under 21 years of age. In both Delaware and Nevada, the legal age for sports gambling is 18.

#  NY Court Upholds Law That Sports Gambling Is Legal At 18

The state’s highest court has upheld a law that allows sports gambling at 18, dealing a blow to the NFL and other professional sports leagues that had challenged the law.

Justices ruled 5-2 on Wednesday that the constitutionality of the 2017 law does not violate the state’s constitution.

The NFL and other leagues had argued that New York was obliged to adopt a federal law that prohibits most sports gambling under most circumstances.

But the court said the federal law doesn’t preclude New York from authorizing sports betting at 18. It said such authorization is a “valid exercise of state police power.”

#  Delaware Opens Door To Sports Betting, No Age Limit

Delaware became the first state to legalize full-blown sports betting since the Supreme Court lifted a federal ban in May. Bettors must be at least 21 years old, but there is no restriction on how many bets they can place.

The state’s three casinos – Delaware Park, Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway & Casino – can begin taking sports bets as soon as Thursday. They will offer a variety of wagers on professional and college sporting events, including football, basketball, baseball and hockey.
