#  Hanuman Bingo Game at Whiskey Pete's Internet Casino

Whiskey Pete's Internet Casino is proud to offer the Hanuman Bingo game. This exciting new game is based on the Hindu god, Hanuman. The objective of the game is to collect as many points as possible by marking off numbers on your bingo card that are called.

There are a total of 25 numbers in the game, and they are all randomly drawn from a pool of numbers 1-75. The first player to mark off all 25 numbers on their bingo card wins the game!

If you're not familiar with Hindu mythology, don't worry - we'll give you a quick primer on Hanuman before we get into the gameplay details.

Hanuman is a Hindu god who is revered for his strength, courage, and devotion to Rama. He is also known for his incredible feats of athleticism and agility. In some stories, he is able to fly through the air by using his powerful monkey tail.

Now that you know a little bit about Hanuman, let's take a look at the rules of the bingo game.

The game begins with the player selecting five numbers from 1-25 to be their "bingo" numbers. These numbers can be any combination of five different numbers, but they must all be unique. Once the player has selected their bingo numbers, they are given a bingo card with 25 squares numbered 1-75.


     The player then proceeds to mark off any numbers on their card that are called during the game. As each number is called, it will be highlighted on both the caller's board and on all of the players' cards. If one of your selected bingo numbers is called, you can mark it off on your card as soon as it's announced. The first player to mark off all 25 of their bingo numbers (or whoever has the most marked off when time runs out) wins the game!
