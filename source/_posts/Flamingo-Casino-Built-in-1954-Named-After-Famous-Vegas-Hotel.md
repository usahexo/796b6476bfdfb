#  The Flamingo Casino: A Look Back at the Iconic Las Vegas Establishment

The Flamingo casino has been a mainstay of the Las Vegas Strip since its inception in 1946. Located at the southern end of the iconic thoroughfare, the Flamingo has seen its share of highs and lows during its more than 70-year history. Here’s a look back at some notable moments from the casino’s past.

The Flamingo was originally opened by Bugsy Siegel, one of the most infamous gangsters of all time. Siegel was a part of the mob and is credited with helping to build Las Vegas into the gambling mecca it is today. Unfortunately, he didn’t live to see his creation reach its full potential; Siegel was killed in 1947, just months after the Flamingo’s grand opening.

Despite this early setback, the Flamingo went on to become one of Las Vegas’ most iconic casinos. It was home to some of Sin City’s most legendary entertainers, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. In fact, the Rat Pack moniker was coined due to their regular appearances at the Flamingo in the 1950s and 60s.

The casino has also seen its share of drama over the years. In 1985, Ted Binion – son of legendary Las Vegas casino owner Benny Binion – was found dead in his room at the Flamingo. The circumstances surrounding his death remain mysterious to this day.

In more recent years, however, the Flamingo has fallen on hard times. It was sold by Harrah’s Entertainment (now Caesars Entertainment) in 2005 and has changed hands several times since then. The casino has been buffeted by competition from newer and flashier establishments on the Strip and currently ranks near the bottom of Nevada’s gambling revenue rankings.

Nevertheless, the Flamingo remains an important part of Las Vegas history and continues to attract tourists from all over the world. Here’s to another 70 years!
