#  Who is George Walker Bush? 

George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He was also the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.

Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to Barbara and George H. W. Bush. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. He married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. In 2000, he was elected president as a Republican defeating Al Gore after a controversial election result.

During his eight years in office, Bush faced criticism for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina and the 2008 financial crisis. The economic recession caused unemployment rates to rise to 10 percent in 2009 and his approval ratings to drop below 25 percent. After leaving office, Bush wrote a memoir and has been involved in charity work. In 2013, he published Decision Points, a book about key decisions he made during his presidency.

Bush is currently the oldest living former President and second-oldest living former President after Jimmy Carter.

#  When does George Walker Bush 2022 take place?

In May of 2021, George Walker Bush announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2022 election. After a long and heated race against many other contenders, he was eventually picked as the party’s nominee. In November of that year, he was elected to his second term as President of the United States.

Bush’s policies during his second term were largely unchanged from those during his first term. He continued to advocate for lower taxes, deregulation, and free trade. He also continued to support the War on Terror and the Iraq War.

One major event of Bush’s second term was the financial crisis of 2007-2008. This crisis led to the Great Recession, which lasted until around mid-2010. The recession had a significant impact on the U.S. economy and Bush’s approval ratings plummeted as a result.

Despite this, Bush was able to successfully finish his second term in office. Upon leaving office, he retired to Dallas, Texas, where he currently resides with his wife Barbara Pierce Bush.
