#1 Look at their betting pattern
When looking at a player's betting pattern, you want to keep an eye out for players who are consistently betting large sums of money. These players are usually trying to take down the entire prize pool and are not interested in making smaller profits along the way. As a result, these players are more likely to lose than win in the long run.

#2 Watch their play style
Watching how a player plays can tell you quite a bit about their strategy. Players who are aggressive and constantly betting big are more likely to be bad players than those who take their time in making decisions. Similarly, players who make lots of mistakes are also likely to be bad players. So if you see someone making lots of mistakes, it's best to stay away from them!

#3 Check their results history
If you're looking for someone specific to stay away from, then checking their results history might be your best bet. Doing so will show you how often they've won and lost in the past. This information can help you decide whether or not it's worth playing against them. Generally speaking, if someone has lost more times than they've won, it's best to stay away from them!
