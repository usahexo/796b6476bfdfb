	  <h1 id="What-inspired-the-makers-of-Casino-Royale"><a href="#What-inspired-the-makers-of-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="What inspired the makers of Casino Royale?"></a>What inspired the makers of Casino Royale?</h1><p>The first hit movie of the James Bond franchise, Casino Royale, was released on November 17th, 2006. It was both a critical and commercial success and has spawned several sequels since its release. But what inspired the makers of this movie in the first place?</p>
<p>In an interview with IGN, Producer Barbara Broccoli revealed that the idea for Casino Royale originally came from her father, Albert R. Broccoli - also known as “Cubby” Broccoli. He was inspired by a book written by Ian Fleming called “Casino Royale” which was published in 1953. The book is actually a collection of short stories featuring James Bond and is not a novel per se.</p>
<p>However, Cubby Broccoli decided to develop it into a movie instead and hired screenwriter Richard Maibaum to come up with a script. The movie would eventually go through several rewrites before it was finally greenlit and filming could commence.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Cubby Broccoli initially offered the directing job to Stanley Kubrick but he turned it down. Then, Martin Campbell was eventually chosen to helm the project and did an excellent job in bringing it to life on the big screen.</p>
<p>Now that Casino Royale is celebrating its 10 year anniversary, it’s interesting to look back at what inspired its creation in the first place. And while some may argue that Cubby Broccoli took some creative liberties in adapting Fleming’s book for the big screen, the end result is still an enjoyable movie experience.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-the-movie-compare-to-Fleming’s-novel"><a href="#How-does-the-movie-compare-to-Fleming’s-novel" class="headerlink" title="How does the movie compare to Fleming’s novel?"></a>How does the movie compare to Fleming’s novel?</h1><p>When one reads Fleming’s novel, it is hard not to think of the movie. The film adaptation of Goldfinger is generally considered to be one of the best ever made, with a perfect mix of action, humor and romance. Although the novel has all these elements as well, there are some key differences.</p>
<p>For one, the movie does not include the scene in which Bond seduces Pussy Galore. This alteration was made because it was felt that her lesbianism would not go over well with American audiences. In addition, Oddjob does not die in the book; he gets into a fight with Bond and is simply knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous change from book to movie is the ending. In Fleming’s novel, Goldfinger is killed when Bond shoots him in the head. However, in the movie Goldfinger escapes and is never brought to justice. Some believe that this change made the ending less satisfying for viewers.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-of-the-film’s-most-memorable-scenes"><a href="#What-are-some-of-the-film’s-most-memorable-scenes" class="headerlink" title="What are some of the film’s most memorable scenes?"></a>What are some of the film’s most memorable scenes?</h1><p>The shower scene in Psycho is one of the most famous, and iconic, scenes in all of film history. It is so well known that it has even been referenced and parodied in many other films over the years.</p>
<p>Another memorable scene from Psycho is the infamous ending, where Norman Bates is revealed to be the killer. This scene is still talked about to this day, and remains one of the most shocking endings in movie history.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-Daniel-Craig-become-James-Bond"><a href="#How-did-Daniel-Craig-become-James-Bond" class="headerlink" title="How did Daniel Craig become James Bond?"></a>How did Daniel Craig become James Bond?</h1><p>007 star Daniel Craig has revealed that turning down the role of James Bond twice almost cost him his career.</p>
<p>He said that he was “very close” to being sacked by his agents after rejecting the chance to play the superspy in 1995 and again in 2004.</p>
<p>Craig, who was speaking to GQ magazine, said: “I was very close to getting fired twice from my agents for turning down Bond.</p>
<p>“The first time, I was 24 and the movie was going to be produced by Barbara Broccoli and directed by Michael Apted, and I just didn’t want to do it. I didn’t think I was ready.</p>
<p>“The second time was later on, when Pierce Brosnan had just done Die Another Day and they were kind of desperate to replace him. And I just felt like I needed a break.”<br>The 47-year-old actor added that he is now grateful for being given a third chance to play 007 in 2006’s Casino Royale.<br>He said: “It’s worked out well for me - I’m very happy playing Bond.”</p>
<h1 id="Who-else-appeared-in-the-cast"><a href="#Who-else-appeared-in-the-cast" class="headerlink" title="Who else appeared in the cast?"></a>Who else appeared in the cast?</h1><p>The cast of “Avengers: Infinity War” is a star-studded affair, with some of the biggest names in Hollywood. In addition to Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Chris Evans (Captain America), and Chris Hemsworth (Thor), the film also features Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk), Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange), and many more.</p>
<p>Josh Brolin (Thanos) leads the villainous ensemble, which also includes Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Karen Gillan (Nebula), Pom Klementieff (Mantis), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Dave Bautista (Drax), Bradley Cooper (Rocket Raccoon), and Vin Diesel (Groot).</p>
<p>While the film’s focus is on the Avengers and their struggle against Thanos, it’s always fun to see our favorite superheroes team up with other superpowered beings. In “Infinity War,” fans will get to see Iron Man and Spider-Man join forces, Thor and the Hulk fight side by side, and Captain America team up with Black Widow and Falcon. There are also several new heroes making their debut in the movie, including Scarlet Witch, Vision, War Machine, and Black Panther.</p>
