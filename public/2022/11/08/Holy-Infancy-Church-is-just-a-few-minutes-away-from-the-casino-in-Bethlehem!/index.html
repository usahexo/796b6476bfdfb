	  <h1 id="Holy-Infancy-Church-is-just-a-few-minutes-away-from-the-casino-in-Bethlehem"><a href="#Holy-Infancy-Church-is-just-a-few-minutes-away-from-the-casino-in-Bethlehem" class="headerlink" title="Holy Infancy Church is just a few minutes away from the casino in Bethlehem!"></a>Holy Infancy Church is just a few minutes away from the casino in Bethlehem!</h1><p>Holy Infancy Church is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and just a few minutes away from the casino. This Catholic church offers masses every day, and has a rich history dating back to 1741.</p>
<p>The church was originally built as a log cabin, and was used as a place of worship for the German settlers in the area. The current building was constructed in 1839, and features beautiful stained glass windows and Gothic architecture.</p>
<p>Holy Infancy Church is a popular tourist attraction in Bethlehem, and is often visited by pilgrims who are traveling to nearby sites such as the Casino and the Steel Stacks. The church is open daily from 9am to 4pm, and offers guided tours on Sundays at 12:30pm.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-isn’t-far-from-church-for-those-looking-for-a-little-bit-of-both-worlds"><a href="#Casino-isn’t-far-from-church-for-those-looking-for-a-little-bit-of-both-worlds" class="headerlink" title="Casino isn’t far from church for those looking for a little bit of both worlds!"></a>Casino isn’t far from church for those looking for a little bit of both worlds!</h1><p>Las Vegas is an entertainment wonderland, with world-renowned casinos and resorts lining the famous Strip. But for those who want to enjoy the best of Las Vegas’ gaming and nightlife scene, and also take in a touch of culture, remember that the city’s beautifully ornate Catholic Cathedral, St. Peter’s, is just a short walk from the bright lights of the casinos.</p>
<h1 id="At-the-foot-of-the-Fremont-Street-Experience-canopy"><a href="#At-the-foot-of-the-Fremont-Street-Experience-canopy" class="headerlink" title="At the foot of the Fremont Street Experience canopy"></a>At the foot of the Fremont Street Experience canopy</h1><p>St. Peter’s is located at the foot of the Fremont Street Experience canopy in downtown Las Vegas. The imposing Gothic Revival structure features twin spires that soar above downtown, making it easy to spot from many parts of town. The cathedral was originally completed in 1909, although it has been extensively remodeled over the years.</p>
<h1 id="A-popular-stop-on-wedding-tours"><a href="#A-popular-stop-on-wedding-tours" class="headerlink" title="A popular stop on wedding tours"></a>A popular stop on wedding tours</h1><p>The cathedral is a popular stop on wedding tours, as its lavish interior can accommodate large ceremonies. However, anyone can enjoy a visit to this historic church - no matter what your religion (or lack thereof). Admission is free and mass is held several times each day. And if you’re feeling lucky, consider taking a spin on one of St. Peter’s two massive pipe organs!</p>
<h1 id="Bethlehem-welcomes-new-casino-with-open-arms-and-close-proximity-to-Holy-Infancy-Church"><a href="#Bethlehem-welcomes-new-casino-with-open-arms-and-close-proximity-to-Holy-Infancy-Church" class="headerlink" title="Bethlehem welcomes new casino with open arms - and close proximity to Holy Infancy Church!"></a>Bethlehem welcomes new casino with open arms - and close proximity to Holy Infancy Church!</h1><p>The citizens of Bethlehem are excited at the prospect of a new casino in their town - and its close proximity to the Holy Infancy Church!</p>
<p>The casino is set to open in early 2019, and it will be the perfect spot for people looking to have some fun while they’re in Bethlehem. There will be plenty of games to choose from, and the casino’s staff is prepared to help guests have a great time.</p>
<p>In addition to being close to the church, the casino is also close to other popular destinations in Bethlehem. Guests can easily walk to other points of interest, or they can take a short drive if they want to explore more of what the town has to offer.</p>
<p>The casino is sure to be a big hit with locals and tourists alike, so be sure to visit when you’re in Bethlehem!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-won’t-keep-tourists-from-visiting-religious-sites-near-Bethlehem"><a href="#Casino-won’t-keep-tourists-from-visiting-religious-sites-near-Bethlehem" class="headerlink" title="Casino won’t keep tourists from visiting religious sites near Bethlehem!"></a>Casino won’t keep tourists from visiting religious sites near Bethlehem!</h1><p>There’s been a lot of talk in the news lately about the casino that’s being built in Bethlehem and how it will supposedly keep tourists from visiting religious sites in the area. But we don’t think that will be the case at all – in fact, we believe the casino will only help to attract more visitors to the city!</p>
<p>First of all, Bethlehem is a beautiful city with a lot to offer tourists. It’s home to some of the world’s most famous religious sites, like the Church of the Nativity and the Shepherds’ Field, and there’s also plenty of history and culture to explore. Plus, thanks to its location near Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Bethlehem is well-connected to other major tourist destinations in Israel.</p>
<p>Second of all, casinos are always popular attractions for tourists. They offer a unique experience that can’t be found anywhere else, and they’re always entertaining. We believe that the casino being built in Bethlehem will be no exception – it will be one of the most popular tourist destinations in the city!</p>
<p>So don’t worry – even though there’s a casino being built near Bethlehem, that doesn’t mean you won’t be able to visit all of the city’s famous religious sites. In fact, we think you’ll find that the casino actually helps to promote tourism in Bethlehem!</p>
<h1 id="Church-and-casino-in-close-proximity-to-each-other-in-Bethlehem-some-say-too-close-for-comfort"><a href="#Church-and-casino-in-close-proximity-to-each-other-in-Bethlehem-some-say-too-close-for-comfort" class="headerlink" title="Church and casino in close proximity to each other in Bethlehem - some say too close for comfort!"></a>Church and casino in close proximity to each other in Bethlehem - some say too close for comfort!</h1><p>Church and casino in close proximity to each other in Bethlehem - some say too close for comfort!</p>
<p>When you think of churches and casinos, usually one is not thinking about the two being in close proximity to each other. But that is exactly what you will find in the small town of Bethlehem, PA. There are a surprising number of churches located near the casino district.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of these two institutions has led some people to call into question just how appropriate it is. After all, doesn’t the church represent morality while the casino represents gambling and vice? It’s a fair question to ask.</p>
<p>But there may be more to it than that. One could argue that the church and the casino are actually serving two different constituencies. The church is catering to those who want to lead a moral life, while the casino is catering to those who want to let loose and have a good time.</p>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that the casino offers jobs and revenue for the town, while the church does not. So it’s not as if the casino is taking business away from the church. In fact, they may be complementary institutions that serve different needs in the community.</p>
