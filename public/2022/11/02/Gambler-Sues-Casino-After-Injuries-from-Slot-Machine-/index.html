	  <h1 id="Gambler-Sues-Casino-After-Injuries-from-Slot-Machine"><a href="#Gambler-Sues-Casino-After-Injuries-from-Slot-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Gambler Sues Casino After Injuries from Slot Machine"></a>Gambler Sues Casino After Injuries from Slot Machine</h1><p>A gambler is suing a casino after he was injured while playing a slot machine. The gambler, who has not been identified, claims that he suffered injuries when the lever of the slot machine snapped off and hit him in the face.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which was filed earlier this month in a district court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that the casino is responsible for the injuries sustained by the gambler. The gambler is requesting compensation for medical bills and other damages related to the incident.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a gambler has sued a casino over injuries sustained while playing slot machines. In fact, lawsuits of this nature are becoming increasingly common as people become more aware of their rights.</p>
<p>In one high-profile case, a woman in California sued a casino after she injured her hand while trying to retrieve a quarter from a slot machine. The woman claimed that the casino was negligent for not having safety guards on the machines. She was awarded $3 million in damages.</p>
<p>So far, the casino involved in this latest case has not commented on the lawsuit. It is unclear whether or not they plan to fight it. However, given how common these suits are becoming, it is likely that they will eventually settle out of court.</p>
<h1 id="Man-Turns-to-Casino-Injury-Attorneys-After-Becoming-a-Quadriplegic"><a href="#Man-Turns-to-Casino-Injury-Attorneys-After-Becoming-a-Quadriplegic" class="headerlink" title="Man Turns to Casino Injury Attorneys After Becoming a Quadriplegic"></a>Man Turns to Casino Injury Attorneys After Becoming a Quadriplegic</h1><p>When people enter a casino, they expect a good time. They expect to gamble and have fun. Unfortunately, for one man, that’s not what happened. </p>
<p>The man was gambling at the casino when he fell off of his chair and became a quadriplegic. He is now unable to do anything on his own and is relying on others for help. </p>
<p>Because of the injuries he sustained, the man is now looking into filing a lawsuit against the casino. He is working with casino injury attorneys in order to get the compensation he deserves. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this isn’t an isolated incident. There have been other cases in which people have become injured or even died while at a casino. In fact, casinos are one of the most dangerous places to be. </p>
<p>There are many things that can go wrong in a casino. People can fall, be assaulted, or even die from an overdose. Casino injury attorneys are well-versed in these types of cases and can help those who have been victimized receive the compensation they deserve. </p>
<p>If you or someone you know has been injured at a casino, don’t hesitate to reach out to an attorney. They will be able to help you get the compensation you need as you recover from your injuries.</p>
<h1 id="Woman-Awarded-10-Million-in-Lawsuit-After-Becoming-Disabled-at-Casino"><a href="#Woman-Awarded-10-Million-in-Lawsuit-After-Becoming-Disabled-at-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Woman Awarded $10 Million in Lawsuit After Becoming Disabled at Casino"></a>Woman Awarded $10 Million in Lawsuit After Becoming Disabled at Casino</h1><p>A woman who alleges she became disabled while playing the slot machines at a casino has been awarded $10 million in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The woman, who is only identified as “L.G.”, filed the lawsuit against the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, IL, claiming that the casino was negligent in its operation of the slot machines. L.G. stated that she had been playing at the casino for only 15 minutes when she began to experience shortness of breath and numbness in her left arm. She soon became unable to walk and was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where she was diagnosed with astroke.</p>
<p>In court filings, L.G.’s attorneys argued that the Casino Queen should have known that the machines were hazardous and that they had a duty to protect their players from harm. The casino denied any responsibility for L.G.’s injuries, arguing that she suffered from an unspecified pre-existing medical condition which contributed to her stroke.</p>
<p>However, a jury found in favor of L.G., awarding her $10 million in damages. In making their decision, the jury noted that L.G. had not exhibited any symptoms of stroke before playing the casino slots and that the casino should have been aware of the potential danger posed by their machines.</p>
<h1 id="Group-of-Casino-Injury-Lawyers-Named-in-Class-Action-Lawsuit"><a href="#Group-of-Casino-Injury-Lawyers-Named-in-Class-Action-Lawsuit" class="headerlink" title="Group of Casino Injury Lawyers Named in Class-Action Lawsuit"></a>Group of Casino Injury Lawyers Named in Class-Action Lawsuit</h1><p>The group of casino injury lawyers has been named in a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Nevada, alleges that the lawyers took advantage of clients who were injured at casinos.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the lawyers set up a trust fund for their clients, but only paid out a fraction of what was owed. They also allegedly charged excessive fees.</p>
<p> gambling lawyer “This conduct is nothing less than predatory and disgraceful,” said one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The lawyer representing the casino injury lawyers said that his clients did nothing wrong and that they will fight the allegations.</p>
<h1 id="Attorney-Jamie-Casino-Victorious-in-47-Million-Lawsuit-Against-Casino"><a href="#Attorney-Jamie-Casino-Victorious-in-47-Million-Lawsuit-Against-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Attorney Jamie Casino Victorious in $47 Million Lawsuit Against Casino"></a>Attorney Jamie Casino Victorious in $47 Million Lawsuit Against Casino</h1><p>Alabama-based personal injury and wrongful death attorney Jamie Casino won a $47 million verdict in a lawsuit against Georgia’s Gold Rush Casino &amp; Resort. The jury found that casino negligence led to the death of Casino’s sister, Brandy Schoonover, in a car accident.</p>
<p>Casino first made headlines in 2014 when he aired an explosive 2-minute ad campaign before the Super Bowl. The commercial focused on the death of Schoonover and featured heavy metal music and images of burning cars.</p>
<p>“When you have something like this take place in your life, you have two options: You can give up or you can fight,” said Casino in an interview following the victory. “And my sister would have wanted me to fight. So that’s what I did.”</p>
<p>Casino has built a reputation as a zealous advocate for his clients, often taking on cases other attorneys refuse to touch. In an interview with the Alabama Lawyer, Casino said, “I knew that I had to take this case on. There was no way I could let my sister die in vain. I had to get justice for her.”</p>
<p>The litigation began shortly after Schoonover’s death in December 2013 when Casino filed a Wrongful Death lawsuit against Gold Rush Casino &amp; Resort alleging that casino employees were reckless and negligent in their operation of the business. According to court documents, Schoonover was killed when her car collided with another vehicle at the casino entrance after its driver lost control due to icy conditions on the road.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs presented evidence during the trial alleging that the casino failed to take reasonable precautions given the weather conditions and failed to properly warn drivers of the danger posed by the icy conditions. Defendants denied any wrongdoing and argued that Schoonover was solely responsible for the accident.</p>
<p>After deliberating for less than two hours, the jury returned a verdict awarding $47 million to Casino and his family, including $10 million in punitive damages. Following the verdict, Gold Rush Casino &amp; Resort announced they would be filing an appeal.</p>
