The Champions League is the annual tournament where Europe’s top football clubs battle it out for the title of European champions. This year’s edition is already well underway, and two of Spain’s biggest clubs are still in the running: Sevilla and Real Madrid. </p>
<p>Sevilla qualified for this year’s Champions League as runners-up in La Liga, Spain’s top football division. They’ve had a decent campaign so far, reaching the Round of 16 where they’ll face German giants Bayern Munich. Real Madrid, on the other hand, are defending champions and have been one of the stand-out teams in this year’s tournament. They breezed through their group stage, losing only one game and scoring an impressive 22 goals in the process. They’re currently in the Quarter Finals where they’ll face French side Paris Saint-Germain. </p>
<p>Whichever team makes it all the way to this year’s final, one thing is for sure: it’s going to be a heck of a match. If you’re looking to catch all the action live, then you’re in luck! There are a few ways to watch Champions League matches online – either by streaming them on your computer or watching them on TV.</p>
<p>To stream Champions League matches online, all you need is a valid subscription to one of several online streaming services like DirecTV Now, Hulu with Live TV or Sling TV. These services allow you to watch live TV channels right on your computer or mobile device – no cable or satellite subscription required! Plus, most of them offer free trials so you can test them out before committing. </p>
<p>Another great option for watching Champions League matches is using an over-the-air antenna. If you have an antenna hooked up to your TV, you can watch all the games for free without any subscriptions needed! Just make sure your local CBS station is broadcasting the game – Champions League matches are typically shown on FOX but check your local listings for confirmation). </p>
