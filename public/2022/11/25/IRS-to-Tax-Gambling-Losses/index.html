	  <h1 id="IRS-to-Tax-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#IRS-to-Tax-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="IRS to Tax Gambling Losses"></a>IRS to Tax Gambling Losses</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recently announced that it will start taxing gambling losses. This means that taxpayers can no longer deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income. The change will take effect starting with the 2019 tax year.</p>
<p>The IRS said that the new rule is meant to “ensure consistency” in the way gambling income and losses are treated. Currently, gambling income is taxed, while gambling losses are not.</p>
<p>Taxpayers who have taken advantage of the deduction in the past may be affected by this change. Those who have lost more money than they’ve won while gambling may see their taxes go up as a result.</p>
<p>There has been some criticism of the IRS’s decision, with some saying that it will discourage people from gambling. However, the agency has defended its move, saying that it is simply trying to ensure that all forms of income are treated equally.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Losses-Could-Total-50-Billion"><a href="#Gambling-Losses-Could-Total-50-Billion" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Losses Could Total $50 Billion"></a>Gambling Losses Could Total $50 Billion</h1><p>Americans lost more than $50 billion gambling in 2016, according to a presentation by casino mogul Steve Wynn.</p>
<p>“The business of gaming in America is a $240-billion industry, and the taxes generated from it make it one of the most important businesses in the country,” Wynn said while speaking at the Societe Generale…</p>
<h1 id="Gambler’s-Ruin-The-dark-side-of-gambling"><a href="#Gambler’s-Ruin-The-dark-side-of-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Gambler’s Ruin: The dark side of gambling"></a>Gambler’s Ruin: The dark side of gambling</h1><p>For some, gambling is a fun and harmless way to pass the time. For others, it can be a deadly addiction. Gambling can have serious consequences for the gambler and their loved ones.</p>
<p>Gambling is a form of risk-taking where the player bets money or something of value on the outcome of a game or event. Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>Problem gambling can cause many negative consequences for the gambler and their loved ones. These include:</p>
<p>❖ Debt<br>❖ Lost jobs and income<br>❖ Divorce and family breakdowns<br>❖ Worsening mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression<br>❖ Theft and fraud to fund gambling habits<br>❖ Suicide</p>
<h1 id="The-psychology-of-gambling-losses"><a href="#The-psychology-of-gambling-losses" class="headerlink" title="The psychology of gambling losses"></a>The psychology of gambling losses</h1><p>In any casino, there are winners and losers. But what motivates someone to keep gambling despite experiencing losses?</p>
<p>There is a psychological phenomenon at play known as the “disposition effect” which dictates that people tend to be more attached to losing investments than winning ones. Losing money feels more painful than winning money feels pleasurable, so people tend to hold on to their losing investments longer in the hopes that they will eventually bounce back and recoup their losses.</p>
<p>So why do people gamble if they know they are likely to lose in the long run? Some researchers believe that it’s because people mistakenly believe that they are better at gambling than they actually are. They may think that their good luck will continue indefinitely, or that they can guess which way the cards will fall more often than not. This overconfidence can lead to disastrous consequences for those individuals who suffer from gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Despite the many risks associated with gambling, some people find it impossible to resist the lure of placing bets. This may be because gambling provides an adrenaline rush similar to that experienced by thrill seekers. The excitement of potential winnings can override any negative emotions associated with losses, leading people to continue gambling even when it’s no longer fun or profitable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the psychology of gambling is complex and differs from person to person. Some gamblers are able to enjoy it without any negative consequences, while others can experience serious financial and emotional problems as a result of their addiction. It’s important for everyone involved in the gambling industry – including players, operators and regulators – to understand these psychological factors in order to create a safe and responsible gaming environment.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Deal-with-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#How-to-Deal-with-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="How to Deal with Gambling Losses"></a>How to Deal with Gambling Losses</h1><p>If you’re like most people, you gamble in the hope of winning big. But what happens when things don’t go your way? Losing can be a tough experience, both emotionally and financially. Here are a few tips for coping with gambling losses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge your feelings. Losing can be frustrating and disappointing, so it’s important to take the time to acknowledge how you’re feeling. Denying or ignoring your emotions won’t make them go away.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Talk to someone. It can be helpful to talk to someone about your losses - a friend, family member, therapist, or even a support group. This will allow you to process your feelings and get some guidance on how to move forward.</p>
<p>*Stay positive. It can be easy to get down on yourself after losing money gambling, but it’s important to stay positive and focus on the things you still have going for you. Remember that everyone loses sometimes - it’s not the end of the world.</p>
<p>*Take a break. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by your losses, it might be helpful to take a break from gambling altogether. This will give you time to reassess your goals and strategy, and come back stronger than before.</p>
<p>*Set limits. One of the best ways to deal with gambling losses is to set limits on how much you’re willing to lose each day/week/month. This will help keep your losses in check and prevent you from going too deep into debt.</p>
