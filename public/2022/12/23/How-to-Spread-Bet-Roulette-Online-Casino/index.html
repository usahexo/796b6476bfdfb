In brick-and-mortar establishments, these include slots, poker, blackjack and roulette. Roulette is a particularly intriguing game that involves betting on whether a ball will land in a certain numbered pocket on a spinning wheel. If you’re looking for an exciting spin on this classic game, you might want to try out spread betting roulette.</p>
<p>Spread betting is a type of wagering where you make bets not only on the result of an event but also on the margin of victory or loss. So in roulette, for example, you wouldn’t just bet on whether the ball would end up in black or red, but also whether it would be within 1-18 or 19-36. This makes the game more exciting, as your potential payouts are always changing depending on how far away from the actual result your chosen spread is.</p>
<p>There are now many online casinos that offer spread betting roulette games, so it’s easy to get in on the action from the comfort of your own home. To get started, simply choose an online casino that offers this type of game and create an account. Then head to the casino’s roulette section and select your preferred variant (European or American). Once you’ve done this, you’ll be able to start making bets by selecting one of the spreads available for each number.</p>
<p>When playing spread betting roulette online, it’s important to keep a few things in mind. First of all, always make sure you understand how the game works before placing any bets. This means learning about the different types of spreads available as well as how payouts are calculated. It’s also important to set limits on how much you’re prepared to lose and never bet more than you can afford to lose. Finally, always gamble responsibly and enjoy yourself!</p>

As a new player, you can take advantage of their £500 welcome bonus which can be used on any of their games, including roulette. What’s more, they also offer regular promotions and bonuses which you can take advantage of throughout your time playing here. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet on more than just red or black When it comes to betting on roulette, many players tend to stick to betting on red or black. However, by doing this you’re essentially limiting your chances of winning. Instead, spread your bets out by betting on more than one colour and increasing your chances of winning big! </p>
</li>
<li><p>Try out different betting systems One way to up your game when playing roulette is to try out different betting systems. By doing this, you’ll be able to find one that works best for you and gives you the best chance of winning. There are a number of different systems available so experiment until you find one that suits you. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Play live dealer games One great way to improve your roulette skills is to play live dealer games. These games are just like traditional online casino games but are played with a live dealer instead. This gives you the chance to see how the game is played before trying it out for yourself and allows for more interaction with the dealer and other players. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use strategy charts Another great way to improve your game when playing online roulette is by using strategy charts. These charts list all the possible outcomes of each bet along with the correct strategy for each one. By using these charts, you can quickly and easily work out the best bets to make in order to maximise your chances of winning.</p>

While there is no foolproof way to make money gambling, employing some or all of these tips can greatly improve your chances of walking away a winner:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know your odds. Before you even sit down at a roulette table, be sure to familiarize yourself with the different types of bets and the odds associated with each one. This will help you make informed decisions about where to place your bets and minimize your losses in the long run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stick to basic betting patterns. When placing your bets, try to stick to simple betting patterns like inside/outside bets, red/black, or even/odds. This will help you keep track of your winnings and losses more easily and limit your exposure to riskier bets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use betting systems. There are a number of different betting systems that you can use while playing roulette in order to improve your chances of winning. The Martingale system, for instance, is one of the most popular systems out there and simply involves doubling your bet after every loss in order to recoup your losses and hopefully come out ahead in the end.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Manage your bankroll wisely. One of the most important things to remember when playing roulette is to always bet within your means. Don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose and be sure to walk away from the table when you’re ahead instead of chasing your losses. This will help ensure that you enjoy yourself while playing without risking too much money in the process.</p>

<h1 id="Advanced-techniques-for-spread-betting-roulette-at-online-casinos"><a href="#Advanced-techniques-for-spread-betting-roulette-at-online-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Advanced techniques for spread betting roulette at online casinos"></a>Advanced techniques for spread betting roulette at online casinos</h1><p>When most people think of gambling, the first thing that comes to mind is roulette. This classic casino game has been around for centuries and continues to be one of the most popular forms of gambling today. Although basic roulette strategy can help increase your chances of winning, there are some more advanced techniques that can give you an even bigger edge.</p>
<p>One such technique is spread betting. With spread betting, you are not just betting on a single number, but instead you are betting on a range of numbers. For example, you might bet that the ball will land on numbers between 1 and 18 or between 19 and 36. This gives you a lot more options and makes it less likely that you will lose your entire bet if the ball lands on a number that isn’t part of your range.</p>
<p>Another advantage of spread betting is that it allows you to place smaller bets while still enjoying a larger payout potential. For example, if you bet $1 on each number in a traditional roulette wager, your maximum payout would be $36 (assuming a 6:1 payout for a correct roulette bet). However, if you were to place a spread bet with the same odds, your maximum payout would be $648 (assuming a 12:1 payout for a correct spread bet).</p>
<p>Of course, as with any form of gambling, there is always risk involved. But by using these advanced techniques, you can minimize that risk and give yourself a better chance of winning big at online roulette casinos.</p>
