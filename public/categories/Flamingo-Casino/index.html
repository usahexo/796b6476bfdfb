This Catholic church offers masses every day, and has a rich history dating back to 1741.</p>
<p>The church was originally built as a log cabin, and was used as a place of worship for the German settlers in the area. The current building was constructed in 1839, and features beautiful stained glass windows and Gothic architecture.</p>
<p>Holy Infancy Church is a popular tourist attraction in Bethlehem, and is often visited by pilgrims who are traveling to nearby sites such as the Casino and the Steel Stacks. The church is open daily from 9am to 4pm, and offers guided tours on Sundays at 12:30pm.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-isn’t-far-from-church-for-those-looking-for-a-little-bit-of-both-worlds"><a href="#Casino-isn’t-far-from-church-for-those-looking-for-a-little-bit-of-both-worlds" class="headerlink" title="Casino isn’t far from church for those looking for a little bit of both worlds!"></a>Casino isn’t far from church for those looking for a little bit of both worlds!</h1><p>Las Vegas is an entertainment wonderland, with world-renowned casinos and resorts lining the famous Strip. But for those who want to enjoy the best of Las Vegas’ gaming and nightlife scene, and also take in a touch of culture, remember that the city’s beautifully ornate Catholic Cathedral, St. Peter’s, is just a short walk from the bright lights of the casinos.</p>
<h1 id="At-the-foot-of-the-Fremont-Street-Experience-canopy"><a href="#At-the-foot-of-the-Fremont-Street-Experience-canopy" class="headerlink" title="At the foot of the Fremont Street Experience canopy"></a>At the foot of the Fremont Street Experience canopy</h1><p>St. Peter’s is located at the foot of the Fremont Street Experience canopy in downtown Las Vegas. The imposing Gothic Revival structure features twin spires that soar above downtown, making it easy to spot from many parts of town. The cathedral was originally completed in 1909, although it has been extensively remodeled over the years.</p>
<h1 id="A-popular-stop-on-wedding-tours"><a href="#A-popular-stop-on-wedding-tours" class="headerlink" title="A popular stop on wedding tours"></a>A popular stop on wedding tours</h1><p>The cathedral is a popular stop on wedding tours, as its lavish interior can accommodate large ceremonies. However, anyone can enjoy a visit to this historic church - no matter what your religion (or lack thereof). Admission is free and mass is held several times each day. And if you’re feeling lucky, consider taking a spin on one of St. Peter’s two massive pipe organs!</p>
<h1 id="Bethlehem-welcomes-new-casino-with-open-arms-and-close-proximity-to-Holy-Infancy-Church"><a href="#Bethlehem-welcomes-new-casino-with-open-arms-and-close-proximity-to-Holy-Infancy-Church" class="headerlink" title="Bethlehem welcomes new casino with open arms - and close proximity to Holy Infancy Church!"></a>Bethlehem welcomes new casino with open arms - and close proximity to Holy Infancy Church!</h1><p>The citizens of Bethlehem are excited at the prospect of a new casino in their town - and its close proximity to the Holy Infancy Church!</p>
<p>The casino is set to open in early 2019, and it will be the perfect spot for people looking to have some fun while they’re in Bethlehem. There will be plenty of games to choose from, and the casino’s staff is prepared to help guests have a great time.</p>
<p>In addition to being close to the church, the casino is also close to other popular destinations in Bethlehem. Guests can easily walk to other points of interest, or they can take a short drive if they want to explore more of what the town has to offer.</p>
<p>The casino is sure to be a big hit with locals and tourists alike, so be sure to visit when you’re in Bethlehem!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-won’t-keep-tourists-from-visiting-religious-sites-near-Bethlehem"><a href="#Casino-won’t-keep-tourists-from-visiting-religious-sites-near-Bethlehem" class="headerlink" title="Casino won’t keep tourists from visiting religious sites near Bethlehem!"></a>Casino won’t keep tourists from visiting religious sites near Bethlehem!</h1><p>There’s been a lot of talk in the news lately about the casino that’s being built in Bethlehem and how it will supposedly keep tourists from visiting religious sites in the area. But we don’t think that will be the case at all – in fact, we believe the casino will only help to attract more visitors to the city!</p>
<p>First of all, Bethlehem is a beautiful city with a lot to offer tourists. It’s home to some of the world’s most famous religious sites, like the Church of the Nativity and the Shepherds’ Field, and there’s also plenty of history and culture to explore. Plus, thanks to its location near Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Bethlehem is well-connected to other major tourist destinations in Israel.</p>
<p>Second of all, casinos are always popular attractions for tourists. They offer a unique experience that can’t be found anywhere else, and they’re always entertaining. We believe that the casino being built in Bethlehem will be no exception – it will be one of the most popular tourist destinations in the city!</p>
<p>So don’t worry – even though there’s a casino being built near Bethlehem, that doesn’t mean you won’t be able to visit all of the city’s famous religious sites. In fact, we think you’ll find that the casino actually helps to promote tourism in Bethlehem!</p>
<h1 id="Church-and-casino-in-close-proximity-to-each-other-in-Bethlehem-some-say-too-close-for-comfort"><a href="#Church-and-casino-in-close-proximity-to-each-other-in-Bethlehem-some-say-too-close-for-comfort" class="headerlink" title="Church and casino in close proximity to each other in Bethlehem - some say too close for comfort!"></a>Church and casino in close proximity to each other in Bethlehem - some say too close for comfort!</h1><p>Church and casino in close proximity to each other in Bethlehem - some say too close for comfort!</p>
<p>When you think of churches and casinos, usually one is not thinking about the two being in close proximity to each other. But that is exactly what you will find in the small town of Bethlehem, PA. There are a surprising number of churches located near the casino district.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of these two institutions has led some people to call into question just how appropriate it is. After all, doesn’t the church represent morality while the casino represents gambling and vice? It’s a fair question to ask.</p>
<p>But there may be more to it than that. One could argue that the church and the casino are actually serving two different constituencies. The church is catering to those who want to lead a moral life, while the casino is catering to those who want to let loose and have a good time.</p>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that the casino offers jobs and revenue for the town, while the church does not. So it’s not as if the casino is taking business away from the church. In fact, they may be complementary institutions that serve different needs in the community.</p>

		<h1 id="Flamingo-Casino-Built-in-1954-Named-After-Famous-Vegas-Hotel"><a href="#Flamingo-Casino-Built-in-1954-Named-After-Famous-Vegas-Hotel" class="headerlink" title="Flamingo Casino Built in 1954 Named After Famous Vegas Hotel"></a>Flamingo Casino Built in 1954 Named After Famous Vegas Hotel</h1><p>The Flamingo casino was built in 1954, and was named after the adjacent Flamingo hotel. The hotel was built by mobster Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel, and was one of the first luxury hotels in Las Vegas. The casino has gone through several different ownerships over the years, but is currently owned by Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>The Flamingo is a large casino, and features a number of different table games and slot machines. It also has a number of restaurants, bars, and lounges. The casino is particularly popular among high-rollers, and offers a high-limit area for those who want to bet more money.</p>
<p>The Flamingo is also known for its shows. The most popular show at the casino is undoubtedly “Absinthe”, which is a acrobatic and adult-themed show that has been running since 2011. Other notable shows at the Flamingo include “50 Shades! The Parody” and “Human Nature - Jukebox”.</p>
<p>The casino has also been host to a number of famous celebrities over the years. These include the likes of Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and Elton John.</p>
<h1 id="The-Flamingo-Casino-A-Look-Back-at-the-Iconic-Las-Vegas-Establishment"><a href="#The-Flamingo-Casino-A-Look-Back-at-the-Iconic-Las-Vegas-Establishment" class="headerlink" title="The Flamingo Casino: A Look Back at the Iconic Las Vegas Establishment"></a>The Flamingo Casino: A Look Back at the Iconic Las Vegas Establishment</h1><p>The Flamingo casino has been a mainstay of the Las Vegas Strip since its inception in 1946. Located at the southern end of the iconic thoroughfare, the Flamingo has seen its share of highs and lows during its more than 70-year history. Here’s a look back at some notable moments from the casino’s past.</p>
<p>The Flamingo was originally opened by Bugsy Siegel, one of the most infamous gangsters of all time. Siegel was a part of the mob and is credited with helping to build Las Vegas into the gambling mecca it is today. Unfortunately, he didn’t live to see his creation reach its full potential; Siegel was killed in 1947, just months after the Flamingo’s grand opening.</p>
<p>Despite this early setback, the Flamingo went on to become one of Las Vegas’ most iconic casinos. It was home to some of Sin City’s most legendary entertainers, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. In fact, the Rat Pack moniker was coined due to their regular appearances at the Flamingo in the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>The casino has also seen its share of drama over the years. In 1985, Ted Binion – son of legendary Las Vegas casino owner Benny Binion – was found dead in his room at the Flamingo. The circumstances surrounding his death remain mysterious to this day.</p>
<p>In more recent years, however, the Flamingo has fallen on hard times. It was sold by Harrah’s Entertainment (now Caesars Entertainment) in 2005 and has changed hands several times since then. The casino has been buffeted by competition from newer and flashier establishments on the Strip and currently ranks near the bottom of Nevada’s gambling revenue rankings.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Flamingo remains an important part of Las Vegas history and continues to attract tourists from all over the world. Here’s to another 70 years!</p>
<h1 id="Flamingo-Casino-1954"><a href="#Flamingo-Casino-1954" class="headerlink" title="Flamingo Casino - 1954"></a>Flamingo Casino - 1954</h1><p>The Flamingo Casino is a hotel located in Paradise, Nevada, that was opened on December 26, 1954. The casino is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corporation.</p>
<p>The hotel has 1,489 rooms and a 120,000-square-foot (11,000 m2) casino. It was one of the largest hotels in the world at the time of its construction. The hotel was originally built by Chicago mobster Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel and his business partners Meyer Lansky and Carl Laemmle.</p>
<p>Siegel named the property after his girlfriend Virginia Hill, who was nicknamed “The Flamingo”. Actor George Raft was signed to promote the resort, but he did not actually stay there. singer Tony Bennett first performed at the Flamingo in January 1955.</p>
<p>In February 2015, Caesars Entertainment Corporation agreed to sell the Flamingo to Vici Properties Inc. as part of a settlement with creditors.</p>
<h1 id="The-Flamingo-Casino-Was-Completed-in-1954-5-Flamingo-Casino-A-Look-Back-at-Its-Rich-History"><a href="#The-Flamingo-Casino-Was-Completed-in-1954-5-Flamingo-Casino-A-Look-Back-at-Its-Rich-History" class="headerlink" title="The Flamingo Casino Was Completed in 1954 5. Flamingo Casino: A Look Back at Its Rich History"></a>The Flamingo Casino Was Completed in 1954 5. Flamingo Casino: A Look Back at Its Rich History</h1><p>The Flamingo Casino was completed in 1954, and it has been a popular destination for tourists and casino goers alike ever since. The casino is well-known for its opulent design, which was heavily inspired by the art deco movement. In fact, the casino’s original owner, Benjamin Bugsy Siegel, was himself a key figure in the development of art deco.</p>
<p>The Flamingo Casino is also known for its association with some of the most notorious gangsters of all time. Bugsy Siegel, as mentioned earlier, was closely associated with the mob, and his iconic casino was a favorite hangout spot for many notorious criminals. It’s said that the Rat Pack even got its name from the nickname of one of Bugsy’s henchman: “Flamingo.”</p>
<p>Despite its shady past, the Flamingo Casino has always been a popular tourist destination. It’s currently owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation, and it continues to draw in crowds from around the world.
