		<h1 id="Pentagon-Considering-Strike-in-Afghanistan"><a href="#Pentagon-Considering-Strike-in-Afghanistan" class="headerlink" title="Pentagon Considering Strike in Afghanistan"></a>Pentagon Considering Strike in Afghanistan</h1><p>CNN is reporting that the Pentagon is considering a strike in Afghanistan. This would be an escalation of US involvement in the region.</p>
<p>Officials say that the targets of the potential strikes are members of al Qaeda and the Taliban. The US has been involved in airstrikes in Afghanistan since 2001, but this would be the first time that the US has targeted members of these organizations without their presence inside Pakistan.</p>
<p>The decision on whether to strike is still pending, but officials say that they have been developing plans for a possible strike for some time. The White House is said to be supportive of such a strike.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Afghanistan-be-Next"><a href="#Could-Afghanistan-be-Next" class="headerlink" title="Could Afghanistan be Next?"></a>Could Afghanistan be Next?</h1><p>The U.S. is currently in the process of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan as part of the agreements made with the Taliban. The Taliban has been in control of parts of the country since they were ousted from power by the U.S.-led invasion in 2001, and they now appear to be in a much stronger position militarily and politically than at any time since then.</p>
<p>It’s not clear yet what the ramifications of this will be for Afghanistan or for the region more broadly, but there is a real risk that Afghanistan could become a new haven for terrorist groups, as it was prior to 9/11. This could have serious implications for both Afghan civilians and international security.</p>
<p>The Taliban already controls large swathes of territory in Afghanistan, and they are likely to gain even more ground as U.S. troops withdraw. This will give them greater opportunities to train and engage in terrorist activities, which could pose a serious threat to global security.</p>
<p>In addition, with the Afghan government weak and unstable, there is a risk that terrorism will spread beyond Afghanistan’s borders and into other countries in the region. This could have serious consequences for countries such as Pakistan, which is already struggling with security issues.</p>
<p>The U.S. needs to be careful about how it withdraws troops from Afghanistan, and it needs to work closely with allies in the region to ensure that Afghanistan does not become a new breeding ground for terrorism.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Considers-Strike-in-Afghanistan"><a href="#Trump-Considers-Strike-in-Afghanistan" class="headerlink" title="Trump Considers Strike in Afghanistan"></a>Trump Considers Strike in Afghanistan</h1><p>The Trump administration is considering a military strike in Afghanistan, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/world/asia/trump-afghanistan-strike.html">according to The New York Times</a>. This is the latest development in America’s longest war.</p>
<p>In a meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday, President Donald Trump discussed options with his top advisers, including a possible military strike in Afghanistan. The president has been frustrated by the lack of progress in the war and has privately said that he wants to withdraw American troops from the country, but has been persuaded by advisers to stay the course.</p>
<p>A military strike in Afghanistan would be a major escalation of America’s involvement in the war. The United States has about 8,400 troops stationed in Afghanistan, and has been fighting there since 2001.</p>
<p>The president is expected to make a decision on whether to order a strike in Afghanistan within the next few days.</p>
<h1 id="U-S-Mulling-Military-Action-in-Afghanistan"><a href="#U-S-Mulling-Military-Action-in-Afghanistan" class="headerlink" title="U.S. Mulling Military Action in Afghanistan"></a>U.S. Mulling Military Action in Afghanistan</h1><p> and Wants Pakistan to Help</p>
<p>The Trump administration is considering military action in Afghanistan, with the goal of breaking the stalemate and forcing the Taliban to the negotiating table. But they will need Pakistan’s help to do so.</p>
<p>Pakistan is seen as a critical player in bringing about a negotiated settlement in Afghanistan. They have close ties to the Taliban, and have been accused of providing safe haven for the group. But they also have considerable leverage over the Taliban, which could be used to bring them to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has already signaled their desire for Pakistan’s help. In a speech last month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that “We want to work with Pakistan to stamp out terrorism together.” He added that “Pakistan has an opportunity to break its cycle of poverty and extremism and join the community of responsible nations.”</p>
<p>So far, Pakistan has not responded positively to this overture. Pakistani officials have bristled at America’s criticism, and say that they are doing all they can to combat terrorism. They argue that America should do more to help them, especially since they are a key ally in the war against terror.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration can win over Pakistan and get them to help with negotiations in Afghanistan. If they are successful, it could finally lead to a political solution in Afghanistan after years of stalemate.</p>
<h1 id="Strike-in-Afghanistan-Possible"><a href="#Strike-in-Afghanistan-Possible" class="headerlink" title="Strike in Afghanistan Possible"></a>Strike in Afghanistan Possible</h1><p>The president of the United States, Donald Trump, has hinted at the possibility of a strike in Afghanistan. In an earlier tweet, he said that the US was “cocked and loaded” to retaliate after the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier.</p>
<p>A few days later, on August 30, Trump clarified his statement in a series of tweets. “I ended the ridiculous 17 year war in Afghanistan,” he wrote. “Now we are slowly &amp; carefully bringing our troops back home. We went into Afghanistan for one reason: to get Al Qaeda &amp; Osama Bin Laden. We defeated Al Qaeda &amp; Osama Bin Laden.” He added that he is now seeking an agreement with the Taliban so that US troops can come home.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what form a potential strike in Afghanistan might take or when it could happen. The US currently has about 14,000 troops stationed in the country.</p>
<p>The Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack on August 7 that killed an American soldier and 11 others. The attack took place near the US embassy in Kabul. The Taliban said it was targeting “foreign invaders.”</p>
<p>Trump’s apparent willingness to consider a strike comes as his administration continues to negotiate a peace agreement with the Taliban. The hope is that such an agreement will lead to the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan.</p>

		<h1 id="IRS-to-Tax-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#IRS-to-Tax-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="IRS to Tax Gambling Losses"></a>IRS to Tax Gambling Losses</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recently announced that it will start taxing gambling losses. This means that taxpayers can no longer deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income. The change will take effect starting with the 2019 tax year.</p>
<p>The IRS said that the new rule is meant to “ensure consistency” in the way gambling income and losses are treated. Currently, gambling income is taxed, while gambling losses are not.</p>
<p>Taxpayers who have taken advantage of the deduction in the past may be affected by this change. Those who have lost more money than they’ve won while gambling may see their taxes go up as a result.</p>
<p>There has been some criticism of the IRS’s decision, with some saying that it will discourage people from gambling. However, the agency has defended its move, saying that it is simply trying to ensure that all forms of income are treated equally.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Losses-Could-Total-50-Billion"><a href="#Gambling-Losses-Could-Total-50-Billion" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Losses Could Total $50 Billion"></a>Gambling Losses Could Total $50 Billion</h1><p>Americans lost more than $50 billion gambling in 2016, according to a presentation by casino mogul Steve Wynn.</p>
<p>“The business of gaming in America is a $240-billion industry, and the taxes generated from it make it one of the most important businesses in the country,” Wynn said while speaking at the Societe Generale…</p>
<h1 id="Gambler’s-Ruin-The-dark-side-of-gambling"><a href="#Gambler’s-Ruin-The-dark-side-of-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Gambler’s Ruin: The dark side of gambling"></a>Gambler’s Ruin: The dark side of gambling</h1><p>For some, gambling is a fun and harmless way to pass the time. For others, it can be a deadly addiction. Gambling can have serious consequences for the gambler and their loved ones.</p>
<p>Gambling is a form of risk-taking where the player bets money or something of value on the outcome of a game or event. Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>Problem gambling can cause many negative consequences for the gambler and their loved ones. These include:</p>
<p>❖ Debt<br>❖ Lost jobs and income<br>❖ Divorce and family breakdowns<br>❖ Worsening mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression<br>❖ Theft and fraud to fund gambling habits<br>❖ Suicide</p>
<h1 id="The-psychology-of-gambling-losses"><a href="#The-psychology-of-gambling-losses" class="headerlink" title="The psychology of gambling losses"></a>The psychology of gambling losses</h1><p>In any casino, there are winners and losers. But what motivates someone to keep gambling despite experiencing losses?</p>
<p>There is a psychological phenomenon at play known as the “disposition effect” which dictates that people tend to be more attached to losing investments than winning ones. Losing money feels more painful than winning money feels pleasurable, so people tend to hold on to their losing investments longer in the hopes that they will eventually bounce back and recoup their losses.</p>
<p>So why do people gamble if they know they are likely to lose in the long run? Some researchers believe that it’s because people mistakenly believe that they are better at gambling than they actually are. They may think that their good luck will continue indefinitely, or that they can guess which way the cards will fall more often than not. This overconfidence can lead to disastrous consequences for those individuals who suffer from gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Despite the many risks associated with gambling, some people find it impossible to resist the lure of placing bets. This may be because gambling provides an adrenaline rush similar to that experienced by thrill seekers. The excitement of potential winnings can override any negative emotions associated with losses, leading people to continue gambling even when it’s no longer fun or profitable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the psychology of gambling is complex and differs from person to person. Some gamblers are able to enjoy it without any negative consequences, while others can experience serious financial and emotional problems as a result of their addiction. It’s important for everyone involved in the gambling industry – including players, operators and regulators – to understand these psychological factors in order to create a safe and responsible gaming environment.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Deal-with-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#How-to-Deal-with-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="How to Deal with Gambling Losses"></a>How to Deal with Gambling Losses</h1><p>If you’re like most people, you gamble in the hope of winning big. But what happens when things don’t go your way? Losing can be a tough experience, both emotionally and financially. Here are a few tips for coping with gambling losses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge your feelings. Losing can be frustrating and disappointing, so it’s important to take the time to acknowledge how you’re feeling. Denying or ignoring your emotions won’t make them go away.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Talk to someone. It can be helpful to talk to someone about your losses - a friend, family member, therapist, or even a support group. This will allow you to process your feelings and get some guidance on how to move forward.</p>
<p>*Stay positive. It can be easy to get down on yourself after losing money gambling, but it’s important to stay positive and focus on the things you still have going for you. Remember that everyone loses sometimes - it’s not the end of the world.</p>
<p>*Take a break. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by your losses, it might be helpful to take a break from gambling altogether. This will give you time to reassess your goals and strategy, and come back stronger than before.</p>
<p>*Set limits. One of the best ways to deal with gambling losses is to set limits on how much you’re willing to lose each day/week/month. This will help keep your losses in check and prevent you from going too deep into debt.</p>
